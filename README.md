# React tutorial project 7 results - 

This is the result of following a tutorial from freeCodeCamp.org on youtube. [Link to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8&t=12s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)

This is a dynamic webpage made using ReactJs. In this case, an existing code base was provided to practice adding new features onto it. The features that were added onto the existing application was:
<ul>
    <li>Save and sync notes on the browser localStorage</li>
    <li>Make the first line of each note into its title in the sidebar</li>
    <li>Make the most recently edited note the top note in the sidebar</li>
    <li>Delete notes</li>
</ul>

A preview of the page is shown below.
